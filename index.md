Breeder Nikki Horner of Louisville, Kentucky, is credited with developing the Bombay, starting in the late 1950s. Her goal was a sleek, shiny black cat with a muscular body and friendly temperament. British breeders achieved the same look and personality with crosses of Burmese and black domestic shorthairs.

Cookies is a very lively Bombay cat, playful and affectionate, he loves people and is adaptable to many different environments and lifestyles. He prefers to stay indoors so letting him out is a big no-no! 

He was neutered when he was 4 months old and he loves his litter box super clean as he is very particular with his hygiene. He eats mainly dry food but he won't say no to some wet food from time to time!

Ok so this is Cookies.
